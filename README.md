## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Expenses Chart Component
  - The challenge consisted in replicating a expenses chart component in a desktop and mobile view perspective. The user will be able to see a bar chart with the given data in a json file.
  - Here is a screenshot taken from desktop perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript + Chart.js
  - This was a good one to try using a chart library. I've never used a library like Chart.js before and I really wanted to give it a go. I tried looking up from different solutions from different developers and there are a bunch of ways to solve it. However, at first, I thought it would be easier to solve this with a library. Oh boy, I think I was mistaken..
  - I began writing the HTML and CSS and this was not hard. Then, I had to know how to retrieve the data from the json file. After some research on the web, I found a tutorial where shows how to use fetch function and use the data as a promise. This took me some hours to make it work.. After that, I said before, I went through a Chart.js approach. I found out that this is too complicate (at least for me) to understand how to stylish the chart. I really tried hard to know how to make this looking as close as possible to the given design, but there are some flaws in what I did. First, I couldn't use border-radius (don't know how to). The responsiveness is also awkward, when it goes back from the shrinking view, the plot area just completely messes up the margin. The font and other attributes are also not ok. At least, this challenge was a good opportunity to try something new and I learned a lot from it.
